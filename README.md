**farma** (**Fa**rcaster **r**elationships **ma**nagement) is built to make Farcaster Frames v2 
notifications easy, and help you get insights on how users interact with your 
frames notifications.

- When did a user first add your frame?
- How many notifications have you sent them since?
- When did they enable/disable notifications
- Which Farcaster clients are they using to interact with your frame?
